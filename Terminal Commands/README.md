#Terminal Commands

Three separate commands are needed during this process:

1) Un-sign a profile
2) Create a CSR
3) Sign a profile

unsign.sh contains the command needed to remove the signature from a downloaded Configuration Profile

sign.sh contains both the command to create a new CSR (to obtain a signing certificate) as well as the command to sign a profile using the obtained signing certificate.

These commands are also referenced in the Bash Profile section of these resources.
