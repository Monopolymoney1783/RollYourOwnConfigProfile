# Terminal Commands

Three separate commands are needed during this process:

1. [Un-sign a profile](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/blob/master/Terminal%20Commands/unsign.sh)
2. [Create a CSR](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/blob/master/Terminal%20Commands/sign.sh)
3. [Sign a profile](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/blob/master/Terminal%20Commands/sign.sh)

[unsign.sh](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/blob/master/Terminal%20Commands/unsign.sh) contains the command needed to remove the signature from a downloaded Configuration Profile

[sign.sh](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/blob/master/Terminal%20Commands/sign.sh) contains both the command to create a new CSR (to obtain a signing certificate) as well as the command to sign a profile using the obtained signing certificate.

These commands are also referenced in the [Bash Profile](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/tree/master/Bash%20Profile) section of these resources.
