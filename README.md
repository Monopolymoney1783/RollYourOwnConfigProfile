# Roll-Your-Own Configuration Profiles
Resources for my "Roll-Your-Own Configuration Profiles" presentation at JNUC 2019

## [Bash Profile](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/tree/master/Bash%20Profile)

This folder contains some functions that I use in my bash profile to make the workflow go a little quicker. There are also instructions on how to create a bash profile if you don't already have one, as well as how to get bash profiles working again on Catalina after the switch to zsh.

## [Profile Examples](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/tree/master/Profile%20Examples)

This folder contains the before-and-after .mobileconfig files that were used during my presentation at JNUC 2019

## [Terminal Commands](https://github.com/iMatthewCM/RollYourOwnConfigProfile/tree/master/Terminal%20Commands)

This folder contains the commands that I ran in Terminal to remove the signature from downloaded profiles, create a CSR and Private Key, and signing a modifying profile.
